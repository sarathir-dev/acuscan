* **CSS:** For styling the user interface and ensuring responsiveness.
* **JavaScript:** For client-side interactivity and handling API calls.
* **Supabase:** For user authentication and potentially database management.
* **Gemini AI (Google):** For processing medical queries and analyzing uploaded scans to provide educational information.

## Setup and Installation

To run Acu-Scan locally, you will need to:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd Acu-Scan/website
    ```

2.  **Set up Supabase:**
    * Create a project on the [Supabase website](https://supabase.com/).
    * Obtain your Supabase API URL and public API key.
    * Configure the `auth.js` file with your Supabase credentials.

3.  **Integrate Gemini AI:**
    * Obtain an API key from the [Google Cloud AI Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative/language/explore).
    * Update the `script.js` file with your Gemini AI API key and implement the logic for sending queries and handling responses.

4.  **Open the HTML files:**
    * You can directly open the `.html` files (e.g., `index.html`) in your web browser to view the basic structure. However, for full functionality (especially authentication and AI interactions), you might need a local development server.

## Potential Future Enhancements

* **More Detailed Scan Analysis:** Implement more advanced analysis of uploaded scans, providing more specific educational insights.
* **User Accounts and History:** Allow users to create accounts to save their query and scan history.
* **Image Optimization:** Optimize uploaded images for faster processing and storage.
* **Improved UI/UX:** Continuously refine the user interface and user experience based on feedback.
* **Integration with other medical knowledge sources:** Enhance the AI's knowledge base by integrating with reputable medical databases and resources.
* **Support for more scan types:** Expand the types of medical scans that can be analyzed.
* **Multilingual Support:** Allow users to interact with the platform in different languages.
